## Problem Statement

The business needed to understand customer pain points related to GOtv product services across Nigeria, which included issues with subscription payments, faulty box swaps, installation concerns, and missing channel complaints. To address these challenges, specialized service centers were established in 23 locations across 10 states, offering targeted solutions to resolve these customer issues. Each center collected data on their activities using a Microsoft Form, and the backend Excel file was linked as a data source to a Power BI dashboard for analysis and visualization, providing valuable insights to the organization.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Designed a Microsoft Form for Data Capturing from the Locations.
- Step 2 : All submission is saved on an excel file in one drive 
- Step 3 : From Get Data, Excel workbook saved on one drive was used as the source data
- Step 4 : The innovate theme was used to give the black background
- Step 5 : The   slicer visual was used for the location dropdown and product type 
- Step 6 : Unlike the slicer dropdown visual for location and product type , the filter modification for the date range " Between" was used for date.
- Step 7 : Score cards were predominantly used in the dashboard to reflect distinct count of several activities done on the storm project .
- Step 8 : New measures were used to calculate percentages across the dashboard
- Step 9 : Pie chart used mainly in the dashboard for catrgorization
